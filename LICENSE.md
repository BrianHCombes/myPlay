The templated code is licensed by Google under an MIT-style License. Documentation licensed under CC BY 4.0.

The quizki logo is from the [team-quizki/quizki-frontend](https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-frontend) and used here for an Angular6 capiblity mockup for [FrauDeborah](https://github.com/fraudeborah) to learn Angular6. The team-quizki project is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.  Eventually, the logo will be deleted, as the purpose of myPlay is just that for FrauDeborah to experiment with Angular6, before writing code for team-quizki/quizki-frontend, or for that matter, any other project.

All other is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE for now. If and when I add code which I consider my own this license will be updated.
