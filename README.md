The quizki logo is from the [team-quizki/quizki-frontend](https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-frontend) and used here for an Angular6 capiblity mockup for [FrauDeborah](https://github.com/fraudeborah) to learn Angular6. The team-quizki project is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.  Eventually, the logo will be deleted, as the purpose of myPlay is just that for FrauDeborah to experiment with Angular6, before writing code for team-quizki/quizki-frontend, or for that matter, any other project.
